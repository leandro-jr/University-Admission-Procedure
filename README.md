# University-Admission-Procedure
Python project on JetBrains Academy

About
It takes a lot of hard work to enroll in the university of your dreams. Although, we tend to dismiss how difficult it is for the university to handle the document volume. 
In this project, you'll deal with university applicants. You'll implement an algorithm to determine which applicants are going to be enrolled. 
At each stage, the algorithm will gradually become more complex and comprehensive!

Learning outcomes
Practice loops and various mathematical operations. Learn how to handle files and different types of collections such as lists (including nested lists) and dictionaries. 
Put to use the sorting function and see how useful it can be.

What you’ll do and what you’ll learn
1- Calculate the mean score for a single applicant.
2- Set the mean score threshold and determine whether the applicants are going to be enrolled.
3- Now you'll have to deal with a whole list of applicants instead of just one! Find the lucky ones by comparing their GPA score.
4- From now on, every potential student can apply for one particular department of their liking. The ranking takes place between applicants that chose the same department.
5- GPAs are no longer needed as there are final exams after all! Also, applicants can now apply to several departments.
6- More exams! Rank the applicants by the mean score of several final exams.
7- Now the applicants pass an additional exam for their department, and the best score will be chosen to determine the applicant's ranking: either the mean score or the score of the special exam.
